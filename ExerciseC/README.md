# Exercise C - Strings

In this exercise, we dive into string manipulation in Java. The `JavaStrings` class will be developed to perform operations such as:
- Trimming and concatenating strings.
- Creating unique identifiers using string inputs.
- Encoding strings with a secret code by replacing vowels and truncating lengths.

These tasks will enhance your ability to work with the `String` class and introduce regular expression techniques for string processing.
