# Exercise E - UML Implementation

In this exercise, we will implement a program based on a provided UML diagram. The implementation will cover:
- Creating classes and interfaces as specified in the UML.
- Using enumerations and regular expressions for parsing and handling data.
- Ensuring deep cloning of objects and handling invalid inputs with appropriate exceptions.

This exercise will help you understand how to translate UML diagrams into actual code and manage complex class interactions in Java.
