# Exercise B - Arrays

This exercise focuses on working with arrays in Java. We will create a class `SimpleArrays` with various methods to manipulate and process array elements. The key learning outcomes include understanding how to:
- Populate arrays using the `java.util.Arrays` class.
- Implement constructor overloading.
- Handle array operations such as concatenation and cropping.

The tasks will help solidify your understanding of array handling and exception management in Java.
